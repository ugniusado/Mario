## v3.0

Probably most chalenging one and most time consuming part of the task.

1. Firstly needed to update and create a new script for QuestionBlocks.cs, into InvisibleQuestionBlocks.cs

2. Deleted the QuestionBlock script of the invisible block and replaced it with InvisibleQuestionBlocks.cs, added prefab of the coin

3. Added colidder to trigger, when player hits the block.

4. Removed sprite rendering from the invisible block.

## v4.0 (v5.0)

Did not succeed creating goal pole, so i tried makin the UI, which I succeeded

1. modified the code (ScoreManager.cs)

2. Added TextMeshPro UI

3. Generated Mario font asset, so the font would be usable with TextMeshPro

4. Adjusted the canvas position in the game
